# Ethics
While AI can be a powerful aid, it's crucial to use it responsibly and ethically. 
It is imperative that before you use AI tools for any step in the scholarship application process you carefully read all of the requirements to ensure that the competition allows AI usage. There is the possiblility that you come across a sentence like this, " We request that applicants do not use AI tools such as ChatGPT to assist with preparing this essay. The originality of thought and language are highly valued in our evaluation scheme."
In that case, refrain from using AI tools to maintain the integrity of the application process. 


## Ethical Principles

1. **Honesty and Integrity**
   - Always be truthful in your applications.
   - Use AI as a tool for enhancement, not fabrication.

2. **Originality**
   - Ensure that the core ideas and content are your own.

3. **Transparency**
   - If required by the scholarship rules, disclose the use of AI tools.
   - Be prepared to explain how AI was used in your application process.

4. **Fair Use**
   - Adhere to scholarship guidelines regarding the use of external help.

5. **Personal Growth**
   - Use AI as a learning tool to improve your writing and thinking skills.
   - Don't rely solely on AI-generated content without understanding it.
