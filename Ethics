   - Always be truthful in your applications.
   - Use AI as a tool for enhancement, not fabrication.

2. **Originality**
   - Ensure that the core ideas and content are your own.

3. **Transparency**
   - If required by the scholarship rules, disclose the use of AI tools.
   - Be prepared to explain how AI was used in your application process.

4. **Fair Use**
   - Adhere to scholarship guidelines regarding the use of external help.

5. **Personal Growth**
