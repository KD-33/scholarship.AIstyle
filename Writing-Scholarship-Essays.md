# Writing Scholarship Essays

There are multiple different approaches to writing scholarship essays with AI that all depend completely on personal preference and style. We will go over five different methods for you to use.
To see examples of these methods used check out our [Case Studies](Case-Studies.md) page!

## Word Vomit
Sometimes I find myself with the opposite of writer's block, where I just have so many ideas and no clue how to organize them. When that happens I have found that the easiest thing to do is just 'vomit' words into a disarray on a document. Then I tell my AI the parameters for my essay and tell it to use the information/ideas I have so far. Your prompt should look something like this..."Hi! I need to write a 500-800 word essay on the following [insert essay prompt]. Here are the ideas I have so far that I would like you to use [insert word vomit here]."

## All or Nothing (and editing)
Just like the name suggests 

## Double Chat Window
One of my favorite methods is the double chat window. Basically you have the AI answer your essay prompt (but do not tell the AI that it is writing an essay, just tell it to answer the question) then once it provides an answer, you open a new chat and paste the answer in. On the new chat, ask the AI to write an essay using the information provided to answer [insert essay prompt].

## Outline
One of my earliest tries at writing with AI was the Outline method. Early versions of ChatGPT were somewhat 'anit-essay' because the creators didn't want people solely using AIs to write their essays. This made it difficult to get ChatGPT to write a full length essay. Instead, it would write bulleted lists or a few short paragraphs. Although, ChatGPT has always been especially good at organizing information into outlines. For this method, type your prompt/question into the AI and ask it to create an outline for an essay (I would recommend including your desired word length in this). Your prompt should look something like this..."I need to write a 1000-1200 word paper, but I'm having trouble organizing my ideas. Can you write me an outline for a 1000-1200 word paper about misfits and monsters in literature?"
