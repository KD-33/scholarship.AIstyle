# Writing Scholarship Essays

There are multiple different approaches to writing scholarship essays with AI that all depend completely on personal preference and style. We will go over five different methods for you to use.
To see examples of these methods used check out our [Case Studies](Case-Studies.md) page!

## Word Vomit
Sometimes I find myself with the opposite of writer's block, where I just have so many ideas and no clue how to organize them. When that happens I have found that the easiest thing to do is just 'vomit' words into a disarray on a document. Then I tell my AI the parameters for my essay and tell it to use the information/ideas I have so far. Your prompt should look something like this..."Hi! I need to write a 500-800 word essay on the following [insert essay prompt]. Here are the ideas I have so far that I would like you to use [insert word vomit here]."

## All AI (and editing)
Just like the name suggests, this method is literally all AI. I would not suggest this method, but if you're really stumped for ideas this can help show you a rough draft that you can edit and work off of or it may spark your creativity so you can give the AI more guidance. Basically, just type your essay prompt and requirements into your AI and let it go. Your prompt should look something like this..."Hi! Please write a 500-800 word essay on the following [insert topic/essay prompt]."

## Double Chat Window
One of my favorite methods is the double chat window. Basically you have the AI answer your essay prompt (but do not tell the AI that it is writing an essay, just tell it to answer the question) then once it provides an answer, you open a new chat and paste the answer in. On the new chat, ask the AI to write an essay using the following information. Your prompt for the first chat window should look something like this..."Please answer these questions [insert essay prompt questions]." Then your prompt for the second window should look something like this..."Please write me a 500-800 word essay over the following information [insert first window information]."

## My Voice
At the end of the day, you want your writing to still have your flair, your style, your voice. To do this you can give your AI a sample of your writing and ask it to write an essay in that style. Your prompt should look something like this..."

## Outline
One of my earliest tries at writing with AI was the Outline method. Early versions of ChatGPT were somewhat 'anit-essay' because the creators didn't want people solely using AIs to write their essays. This made it difficult to get ChatGPT to write a full length essay. Instead, it would write bulleted lists or a few short paragraphs. Although, ChatGPT has always been especially good at organizing information into outlines. For this method, type your prompt/question into the AI and ask it to create an outline for an essay (I would recommend including your desired word length in this). Your prompt should look something like this..."I need to write a 1000-1200 word paper, but I'm having trouble organizing my ideas. Can you write me an outline for a 500-800 word paper about AI impacts and ethics?"
