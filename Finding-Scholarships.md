# Finding Scholarships

As with any task, different AI models are better equipped to handle different situations, and finding scholarships is no different. I would reccommend using Perplexity.ai or Gemini-1.0-Pro on Poe.com. Both of those AIs are completely free to sign up and use (although sometimes bots on Poe.com sometimes have a limited number of free responses). 

_____

### Perplexity
-Good at finding lists of scholarships  
-Will only provide links that can be accessed without going through a paywall (accessed for free)  
-Sometimes provides links to individual scholarships and sometimes provides links to long lists of scholarships from "scholarship finding" websites  
-Scholarships can be out of date, so make sure to check for application deadlines  
-Short, simple prompts like "Political Science Scholarships for Undergrads" will do the trick  
-You can include more information like GPA, major, extracurriculars, ethnicity, etc. to make the results more specific  

### Gemini-1.0-Pro (on Poe.com)
-Typically will provide you a list of singular scholarships  
-Most of the links work, but occassionaly you will find a 404 error  
-Start with asking Gemini to help you find scholarships and then Gemini will tell you what information it needs to help you find the most specific scholarships (GPA, year in school, major, ethnicity, gender, career goals, extracurriculars, etc.)

As I said before, not all AIs are created equal. While I do heavily encourage the use of ChatGPT, it is not as good at finding scholarships. It will only provide a short list that is full of outdated scholarships. Usually all of their scholarships are from big "scholarship finding" websites. Often times the links that ChatGPT provides don't even lead to a valid webpage, just a 404 error.
