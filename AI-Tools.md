# AI Tools

### Tools for Writing 
- ChatGPT 
- Claude-3.5-Sonnet
- Gemini
- Copilot

Personally, my favorites are ChatGPT and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. I feel that they are easy to use and help me create the best content. 

### Tools for Finding Scholarships
- Perplexity.ai
- ChatGPT

I would recommend using a mix of both Perplexity and ChatGPT for a chance to have the most usable results possible. AIs struggle more with finding scholarships than they do with writing. Sometimes they provide faulty links or out of date scholarships. If you use two platforms then they will typically provide different and varied scholarship options that you can check to see which are best for you to use. 

At ScholarshipsAIStyle we understand that it is not always feasible to pay for a subscription to AI tools, that's why every AI we promote on this site has a completely FREE version! We believe that these resources should be accessible for all students to find and apply for scholarships.
