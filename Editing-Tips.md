# Editing Tips
When editing work that has been created with AI assistance, we need to look for different things. For example if AI generated the entire piece of work, then there is no need to look for grammatical errors. 

## Word Vomit 
- After the AI organizes your ideas, ensure logical flow and smooth transitions between ideas.
- Focus on key ideas that align most with your essay prompt. Eliminate redundancy and off-topic tangents.
- Ensure the result still feels authentic to your style.
- Incorporate personal examples or experiences to enhance authenticity.
- Check that your original ideas are properly integrated and not overshadowed by AI-generated content.  
## All AI (and editing)
- Add your own examples, experiences, or analogies to make the writing feel more personalized.
- Enhance with more critical analysis, supporting evidence, or counterpoints where necessary.
- Ensure the argument aligns with your thesis and is tailored to the prompt.
- Thoroughly verify the AI-generated content for accuracy.
- Rephrase sections in your own words to avoid potential plagiarism issues.
- Ensure the essay adheres to your assignment's specific requirements.
## Double Chat Window
Consistent Style: Ensure the final draft has a consistent tone throughout.
Detailed Feedback: Provide specific guidance to the AI for the second chat (e.g., "Emphasize this point more").
Expand on Key Points: Elaborate on concise AI responses when transforming them into an essay.
Compare Outputs: Identify any inconsistencies or contradictions between the two AI-generated texts.
Blend and Enhance: Combine the best parts of both outputs, adding your own transitions and additional research.
My Voice:
Refinement: Tweak parts that might feel too stiff or off-tone after receiving the AI's response in your style.
Consistency: Ensure the final product aligns with your natural voice, especially for narrative-driven essays.
Simplify Complex Sentences: Break down overly complex AI-generated sentences for clarity.
Style Review: Carefully assess the AI's attempt at mimicking your style, adjusting phrases or sentence structures as needed.
Personal Touch: Add anecdotes or specific examples that the AI couldn't have known.
Outline:
Add Detail: Elaborate on key points with detailed arguments, transitions, and examples.
Check Flow: Ensure the outline's structure flows logically and supports a clear thesis. Adjust sections if necessary.
Expand and Modify: Use the AI-generated outline as a starting point, but be willing to modify it to better organize your thoughts.
Transition Check: Ensure smooth transitions between sections that the outline might not have accounted for.
Alignment: Verify that the final essay's structure still aligns with the original outline, adjusting as necessary.
General tips for all methods:

Proofread: Check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
Cite Sources: Ensure proper citation of any sources used, including those suggested by the AI.
Consistency Check: Review for consistency in argument and tone throughout the essay.
Read Aloud: Catch awkward phrasing or unnatural language by reading the essay out loud.
Peer Review: Have someone else review your work to catch any remaining AI-like language or inconsistencies.
Balance AI and Original Content: Use AI as a tool to enhance your writing process, not to replace your own critical thinking and creativity.
Academic Integrity: Always prioritize honesty about your use of AI tools if required by your institution.
